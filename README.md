# ConUHacksVII
Our first hackathon
Know-Tap is a project that was done within a 24-hour hackathon.
Know-Tap is a smartphone case that contains an NFC chip inside that allows the user to share their portfolio website.
How does it work?
(1). the user buys the smartphone case.
(2). the user taps the case on their phone.
(3). the user will be directed to the log-in/sign-up (first page of the Know-Tap website)
(4). after the user created an account, they will be directed to the second-page which is customize your portfolio website where the user can add photos, social media links resume, and phone number.
(5). we will ask the user to tap the smart case one more time on their phone so the NFC chip will be updated
(6). the user can now use the product to share the portfolio website.
