        Our team is a group of three passionate web designers who have come
        together to participate in the Hackathon at Concordia University. We are
        all driven by a love for technology and a desire to push the boundaries
        of what is possible with web design. We are excited about the
        opportunity to integrate NFC functions into our project and are
        confident that we have the skills and expertise necessary to make it a
        success.
